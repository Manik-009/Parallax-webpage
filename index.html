	<h2>2009 and 2011: An Awkward Teenage Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		A few years after meeting Justin for the first time, Hailey ran into him again at his documentary premiere, Never Say Never. While the pair smiled together for the cameras, romance was most definitely not in the air since Justin was dating former Disney star Selena Gomez at the time.

	<h2>January 3, 2016: That New Year's Kiss</h2>
	<p>
		After Justin's relationship with Gomez ended, rumors started to swirl around his budding relationship with Hailey. At the end of 2015, they went on vacation together and documented their flirty banter on Instagram. But it wasn't until Justin posted a photo of him kissing Hailey that romance rumors were confirmed. We know who they kissed at midnight!

	<h2>February 11, 2016: Justin Predicts Their Marriage</h2>
	<p>
		Although two years before they would actually tie the knot, Justin predicted a future marriage to Hailey in an interview with GQ. "What if Hailey ends up being the girl I’m gonna marry, right?" he shared. "If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it’s always gonna be damaged. It’s really hard to fix wounds like that. It’s so hard...I just don’t want to hurt her.”

	<h2>May 27, 2018: Went From Reunited.</h2>
	<p>
		Somewhere between 2016 and 2018, Hailey and Justin went separate ways (and Justin infamously got back together with Gomez). But, they reignited their former flame in the middle of 2018. Hailey even acknowledged their time apart to The Times saying, "We went through a long period of time when we weren’t friends. We didn’t speak for quite some time, and there was a lot of weirdness that went on. We’ve moved past that."

	<h2>July 7, 2018: ...To Engaged, Real Quick</h2>
	<p>
		During an intimate trip to the Bahamas, Justin proposed to Hailey in a moment she later called "very special." A few days following the milestone, Justin shared the news with a very very very long Instagram caption. "Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindly," he wrote. He continues with a lot more kind words for his fiancée but if you want to cry about the fact that we all lost our chance to become Mrs. Bieber, just read the full post.

	<h2>June 3, 2019: Finally Wearing Wedding Bands</h2>
	<p>
		Although they said 'I do' in the most secret, low-key courthouse ceremony of the year, neither of them were seen wearing wedding bands for months. However, People reported that Hailey was seen leaving a workout class wearing her giant engagement ring paired with a silver band. The same day, Justin posted an Instagram wearing a matching ring!
